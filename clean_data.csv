A PhD position is available within the ""NCCR AntiResist » consortium from the Swiss National Science Foundation on: ""Phages and competing host flora to prevent and/or treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections"".
Starting date: 01.02.2024 or date to be agreed. Financial support is according to SNF guidelines and the position is limited to 48 months.

PhD project outline

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for chronic and acute infections mainly in immunocompromised hosts. Due to its ability to become rapidly resistant to antibiotic therapies, alternative strategies are urgently needed. One option showing increased interest are bacteriophages, whose efficacy have recently been demonstrated to treat a chronic lung infection due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (1). The PhD project aims at the further development of such personalized phage therapies. Specific goals involve the (i) isolation of phages against MDR clinical
P. aeruginosa isolates and their genetic and phenotypic characterization (genome analysis, molecular targets) (ii) application of phage training to select or improve lytic activity of phages (iii) assessment of their capacity to prevent or treat P. aeruginosa infections in combination with antimicrobials and/or host flora in in vitro cell cultures and in non-mammalian hosts.

Host laboratories

The PhD project will be conducted successively in two academic institutions. Until 2026 the PhD will be affiliated to the Department of Microbiology and molecular medicine at the Medical Faculty of the University of Geneva (group of Dr. T. Köhler and Prof. C. van Delden). The PhD thesis project will be completed at the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at the ETH Zürich (group of Prof.
Alexander Harms).

Education and experience

Master in Life Sciences with a special interest in microbiology and host interactions. Skills in DNA sequence analysis and bioinformatics would be an asset. The candidate should be organized and flexible and is expected to develop rapidly the capacity to work independently and to integrate in an interdisciplinary research environment. English proficiency is requested, German and/or French would be an additional asset.

Application and contact

Please send your online application including CV, motivation letter and addresses of two referees via email to Dr. T. Köhler ("

🌐 ","🇨🇭PhD Position in translational microbiology, University of Geneva, Switzerland 

A PhD position is available within the ""NCCR AntiResist » consortium from the Swiss National Science Foundation on: ""Phages and competing host flora to prevent and/or treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections"".
Starting date: 01.02.2024 or date to be agreed. Financial support is according to SNF guidelines and the position is limited to 48 months.

PhD project outline

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for chronic and acute infections mainly in immunocompromised hosts. Due to its ability to become rapidly resistant to antibiotic therapies, alternative strategies are urgently needed. One option showing increased interest are bacteriophages, whose efficacy have recently been demonstrated to treat a chronic lung infection due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (1). The PhD project aims at the further development of such personalized phage therapies. Specific goals involve the (i) isolation of phages against MDR clinical
P. aeruginosa isolates and their genetic and phenotypic characterization (genome analysis, molecular targets) (ii) application of phage training to select or improve lytic activity of phages (iii) assessment of their capacity to prevent or treat P. aeruginosa infections in combination with antimicrobials and/or host flora in in vitro cell cultures and in non-mammalian hosts.

Host laboratories

The PhD project will be conducted successively in two academic institutions. Until 2026 the PhD will be affiliated to the Department of Microbiology and molecular medicine at the Medical Faculty of the University of Geneva (group of Dr. T. Köhler and Prof. C. van Delden). The PhD thesis project will be completed at the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at the ETH Zürich (group of Prof.
Alexander Harms).

Education and experience

Master in Life Sciences with a special interest in microbiology and host interactions. Skills in DNA sequence analysis and bioinformatics would be an asset. The candidate should be organized and flexible and is expected to develop rapidly the capacity to work independently and to integrate in an interdisciplinary research environment. English proficiency is requested, German and/or French would be an additional asset.

PhD position (2024-2028): Coastal morphodynamics in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago

Project overview:
- Coastal communities in the Canadian Arctic are facing coastal hazards and increased exposure to storm waves due to reduced protection from multi-year coastal sea ice.
- Permafrost degradation and sea ice reduction contribute to longer periods of increased wave energy during the open water season, leading to coastal impacts, overwash, and flooding in low-lying areas.
- Major morphological changes along the Nunavut coast have been observed, posing threats to traditional activities and economic development.

Project details:
- Conducted in partnership with the Ikaluktutiak Hunters and Trappers Association and POLAR Knowledge Canada.
- Aims to provide new insights into Arctic coastal morphodynamics.
- Focuses on a barred sandy beach in a fetch-limited environment.
- The candidate will explore the links between storms, permafrost, and nearshore morphology using various technologies.
- Analyzing short- to long-term coastal evolution and identifying the main controlling forces behind coastal changes.
- The project is funded by POLAR and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada.
- Takes place at UQAR (Rimouski) in close partnership with INRS.
- Fieldwork will be conducted in Cambridge Bay, with access to the Canadian High Arctic Research Station (CHARS).

Requirements:
- Seeking a motivated PhD student interested in participative research and fieldwork in remote areas.
- Knowledge of coastal morphodynamics, numerical modeling, geomatics, and remote sensing.
- Implementation of multibeam and drone surveys by the research team.
- Strong emphasis on fieldwork and coastal video analysis using image processing techniques.

👨‍🏫 Dr. Ahmed El Refai

I currently have two available PhD positions at Laval University, situated in Quebec City. As a doctoral candidate, you'll be involved in conducting research within the field of concrete structures reinforced with composites. You'll work under my guidance and collaborate with colleagues within my research team. If interested, email me at: ",,"🇺🇸 PhD Position in Salt Marsh Soil Biogeochemistry, University of Georgia, USA 


The Spivak Coastal Biogeochemistry Lab at the University of Georgia seeks a PhD student for a new project focused on understanding soil organic matter-mineral interactions in salt marshes. These ecosystems provide valuable storm-surge buffering and climate regulation services, in part, through rapid and efficient burial of mineral and organic particles. Physical and chemical associations between organic matter and minerals can enhance carbon burial but the importance of these interactions and how they are affected by the dynamic redox environment of salt marsh soils are not well understood.
The successful candidate will conduct research characterizing soil mineralogy and organic matter composition in salt marshes along the Georgia coast. This broad spatial characterization will be complemented by lab-based experiments testing physical and chemical mechanisms of organic matter protection under varying redox conditions. In addition to advancing wetland soil science theory, this research will assist state and federal partners in identifying properties of dredge material that can enhance carbon burial in beneficial use projects.
The student will gain experience in advanced geochemical and organic matter characterization techniques.
Chemical transformations of organic matter in the lab experiments will be captured at the scale of compounds, minerals, and microbes, thereby providing fine-scale mechanistic information that is necessary for understanding large-scale spatial patterns. The student will gain insight into coastal management projects by working collaboratively with government partners to co-develop decision support tools that match dredge material with beneficial use projects for the co-benefit of enhanced carbon storage.
At the time of appointment, highly qualified applicants will have a masters or undergraduate degree in chemistry, geology, geoscience, soil science, or a related field. Ideal candidates will have knowledge of biogeochemical processes, experience using wet-lab chemical procedures, conducting fieldwork in tidal wetlands, and using GIS, as well as excellent quantitative, written, and interpersonal skills. Preference to those with masters degrees but highly qualified candidates with bachelor degrees will be considered.

Title: Development of a Hybrid Intensified Photobioreactor for Sustainable Microalgae Cultivation

PhD Thesis Subject: 
The PhD thesis aims to develop a hybrid intensified photobioreactor for the sustainable cultivation of microalgae, with a focus on the solar production of microalgae for CO2 valorization into biofuels. The research will be conducted at the GEPEA Laboratory, under the supervision of Jeremy Pruvost, Mariana Titica, and Pierre Albrand.

Laboratory and University:
- Laboratory: GEPEA UMR CNRS 6144 (équipe BAM), AlgoSolis core-facility
- University: Nantes Université

Funding:
The PhD thesis is funded by the European Project - Cocpit.

Description:
The GEPEA Laboratory has developed an innovative photobioreactor technology called AlgoFilm©, which enables intensified culture of microalgae. This technology, based on a streaming film principle, achieves high volumetric productivity surpassing the state of the art.

The research work will be conducted within the framework of the European project COCPIT, focusing on jet-fuel production by microalgae for aviation. The objective is to extend the AlgoFilm concept to a hybrid system by integrating semi-transparent photovoltaic panels on the photobioreactor cover. This integration aims to co-produce electricity from captured solar flux. The research will involve studying and optimizing the coupling between the photovoltaic panels and the photobioreactor for the production of liquid biofuels. This optimization will consider the use of the solar spectrum (photosynthesis vs. photovoltaics) and the minimization of energy consumption, particularly associated with thermal regulation.

The research will also involve studying the effect of the specific conditions generated by this technology on the growth kinetics of microalgae. These conditions include high solar exposure, high growth rate, particular hydrodynamics, and rapid dynamics of light, temperature, and oxygen concentration. The study will involve both experimental investigations and modeling of these effects.

The PhD thesis will cover the following points:
1. Experimental study and modeling of the AlgoFilm process's operating conditions (extreme temperatures, high concentrations of dissolved oxygen) and the culture medium composition (nitrogen) on the growth kinetics of microalgae and their lipid content.
2. Modeling the hybrid system by integrating the growth kinetic model obtained from the AlgoFilm process with a semi-transparent photovoltaic panel. The aim is to optimize control strategies in outdoor conditions using in-silico simulations.
3. Global validation of the developed models and strategies on solar pilot units.

The research will utilize the tools available at the GEPEA laboratory, including the newly built AlgoFilm photobioreactor at the AlgoSolis facility (",,,,"🇨🇦 Postdoctoral Position, University of Calgary, Canada

☑️ Business and sustainability 

👩🏻‍🏫 Dr. Jukka Rintamäki:


My department at Aalto University is looking for a PhD student in business and sustainability - deadline August 28! It's a fairly standard Aalto arrangement, with the first two years of funding guaranteed, and a possibility for an extension. Finland has many foundations from which you can get more funding with very reasonable effort. The community is very nice, and material circumstances around work, living etc. are great.

I think we're looking for someone ambitous in terms of what sustainability means and looks like (I hesitate to use the word radical, but there you have it), rather than your standard corporate sustainability / CSR person.

"🇺🇸 PhD Position in Salt Marsh Soil Biogeochemistry, University of Georgia, USA 


The Spivak Coastal Biogeochemistry Lab at the University of Georgia seeks a PhD student for a new project focused on understanding soil organic matter-mineral interactions in salt marshes. These ecosystems provide valuable storm-surge buffering and climate regulation services, in part, through rapid and efficient burial of mineral and organic particles. Physical and chemical associations between organic matter and minerals can enhance carbon burial but the importance of these interactions and how they are affected by the dynamic redox environment of salt marsh soils are not well understood.
The successful candidate will conduct research characterizing soil mineralogy and organic matter composition in salt marshes along the Georgia coast. This broad spatial characterization will be complemented by lab-based experiments testing physical and chemical mechanisms of organic matter protection under varying redox conditions. In addition to advancing wetland soil science theory, this research will assist state and federal partners in identifying properties of dredge material that can enhance carbon burial in beneficial use projects.
The student will gain experience in advanced geochemical and organic matter characterization techniques.
Chemical transformations of organic matter in the lab experiments will be captured at the scale of compounds, minerals, and microbes, thereby providing fine-scale mechanistic information that is necessary for understanding large-scale spatial patterns. The student will gain insight into coastal management projects by working collaboratively with government partners to co-develop decision support tools that match dredge material with beneficial use projects for the co-benefit of enhanced carbon storage.
At the time of appointment, highly qualified applicants will have a masters or undergraduate degree in chemistry, geology, geoscience, soil science, or a related field. Ideal candidates will have knowledge of biogeochemical processes, experience using wet-lab chemical procedures, conducting fieldwork in tidal wetlands, and using GIS, as well as excellent quantitative, written, and interpersonal skills. Preference to those with masters degrees but highly qualified candidates with bachelor degrees will be considered.

PhD and Postdoc vacancies at the Shaping Matter Lab, TU Delft
We're seeking applicants to develop new engineered living materials and bring the remarkable power of biological matter to engineering materials.
Job / Project Description
Biological materials exhibit impressive mechanical properties due to their hierarchical structures, low embodied energy, and their ability to grow, sense and adapt to their environments. Until now, engineering materials remain lifeless, with limited ability to sense and adapt to stresses or damage.
Our recently funded ERC Consolidator project AM-IMATE aims to bridge the gap between biology and materials science, by utilizing additive manufacturing to realize complex, bio-inspired composite structures that sense and react to their changing environment. This project builds on recent developments showing that fungal mycelium reacts to environmental stresses will contribute to the broader field of engineered living composite materials. Within this general theme, we have several vacancies for PhD and Postdocs.
Our Group
The Shaping Matter lab, Department of Aerospace Structures and Materials, Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TU Delft is currently welcoming applications for PhDs and Postdocs in bio-inspired materials, biology/biophysics, and data-driven additive manufacturing. During your research, you will fulfil the vision of the AM-IMATE project, to develop adaptive living composite materials. You will work across disciplines, to investigate how materials interact with living organisms, and how we can harness shape and electrostimulation to guide morphogenesis. Additionally, you will pioneer novel additive manufacturing methods for crafting intricate living structures. You will collaborate closely with other members of the lab and combine efforts to explore the many untapped functions of biological materials.
Requirements
You hold a masters or PhD in biology or engineering discipline, with your thesis focused on engineered living materials, biophysics or additive manufacturing of living matter. You have a scientific track record through the achievements in your research. You are proficient in meticulous lab work, programming and skilled in turning an idea into a prototype implementation. You enjoy pioneering new ideas, linking results with physical experiments and thrive in an interactive, collaborative research environment. Further, you have good English communication skills and a strong drive for academic excellence.

Our collaborative project, building on promising preliminary results, seeks to create intelligent offloading insoles that dynamically redistribute plantar pressure. Leveraging 3D printing technology, we aim to embed plantar temperature and pressure sensing technologies into smart insoles. This innovation will contribute to the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals at risk of diabetes-related complications.

Project #2: The project centres on the fatigue testing of fluid-filled lattice structures, specifically in the realm of 3D printing technology. These lattice structures have shown immense promise in various applications, and your research will contribute to a deeper understanding of their fatigue behaviour. The objective is to optimize their design, ensuring longevity and reliability in real-world applications such as smart insoles.

Qualifications:

A strong academic background in biomechanics/ mechanical engineering, materials science, or a related field.
GPA >18.5/20 (should be eligible for UoA doctoral scholarship)
Eagerness to contribute to collaborative research initiatives.

The future electric power grid will be power-electronics dominated. This is needed to massively connect renewable energy sources as well as energy storage, and transmission assets such as high-voltage direct current (HVDC). Grid-connected converters take over the role of traditional grid control components such as synchronous generators. 
A vital question is then how to achieve interoperability between converters at all levels, both distribution and transmission. The interplay between technology, standardization, grid codes, verification methods, and openness will be investigated in the project.

"🇨🇭PhD Position in translational microbiology, University of Geneva, Switzerland 

A PhD position is available within the ""NCCR AntiResist » consortium from the Swiss National Science Foundation on: ""Phages and competing host flora to prevent and/or treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections"".
Starting date: 01.02.2024 or date to be agreed. Financial support is according to SNF guidelines and the position is limited to 48 months.

PhD project outline

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for chronic and acute infections mainly in immunocompromised hosts. Due to its ability to become rapidly resistant to antibiotic therapies, alternative strategies are urgently needed. One option showing increased interest are bacteriophages, whose efficacy have recently been demonstrated to treat a chronic lung infection due to multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (1). The PhD project aims at the further development of such personalized phage therapies. Specific goals involve the (i) isolation of phages against MDR clinical
P. aeruginosa isolates and their genetic and phenotypic characterization (genome analysis, molecular targets) (ii) application of phage training to select or improve lytic activity of phages (iii) assessment of their capacity to prevent or treat P. aeruginosa infections in combination with antimicrobials and/or host flora in in vitro cell cultures and in non-mammalian hosts.

Host laboratories

The PhD project will be conducted successively in two academic institutions. Until 2026 the PhD will be affiliated to the Department of Microbiology and molecular medicine at the Medical Faculty of the University of Geneva (group of Dr. T. Köhler and Prof. C. van Delden). The PhD thesis project will be completed at the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at the ETH Zürich (group of Prof.
Alexander Harms).

Education and experience

Master in Life Sciences with a special interest in microbiology and host interactions. Skills in DNA sequence analysis and bioinformatics would be an asset. The candidate should be organized and flexible and is expected to develop rapidly the capacity to work independently and to integrate in an interdisciplinary research environment. English proficiency is requested, German and/or French would be an additional asset.

Application and contact

Please send your online application including CV, motivation letter and addresses of two referees via email to Dr. T. Köhler (",,,,,,,
